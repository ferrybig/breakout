# Breakout

This is a Javascript breakout game. This game was made to demonstrate my knowledge about the Javascript module pattern.

## Input

This game allows for differend methods of input:
 - Mouse
 - Keyboard arrow keys
 
 To prevent the keyboard from looking really sensentive, there is a small smooting effe applied so its looks visually more pleasing.

 - `Powerup.activatePower("exploding")` - Explode on impact

 - `Powerup.activatePower("holdball")` - The paddle holds the ball
